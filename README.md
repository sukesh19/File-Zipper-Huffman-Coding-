Based on the search results for similar Huffman coding file compression projects, here's what a typical File Zipper using Huffman Coding README would contain:

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a **File Zipper application** using the **Huffman Coding Algorithm** for lossless data compression and decompression[1][2]. The application can compress and decompress text files by utilizing frequency-based encoding to achieve significant file size reduction.

## üî¨ Huffman Coding Algorithm

### Algorithm Description

Huffman Coding is a **greedy algorithm** that assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence[1][3]. The algorithm works by:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: Counting how often each character appears in the input file
2. **Tree Construction**: Building a binary tree where frequently used characters get shorter codes
3. **Code Assignment**: Assigning binary codes based on tree traversal paths
4. **Compression**: Replacing original characters with their corresponding Huffman codes

### Key Principles

- **Lossless Compression**: No data is lost during the compression process[4]
- **Variable Length Encoding**: More frequent characters get shorter codes[3]
- **Prefix Rule**: No code is a prefix of another, ensuring unique decodability[4]
- **Greedy Approach**: Always selects the two nodes with minimum frequency for tree construction[1]

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **File Compression**: Compress text files using Huffman encoding
- **File Decompression**: Restore original files from compressed versions
- **Lossless Process**: Complete data integrity maintained throughout the process
- **Frequency Analysis**: Display character frequency statistics
- **Compression Ratio**: Calculate and display compression effectiveness

### Technical Capabilities
- **Binary File Handling**: Support for various file types[1]
- **Tree Reconstruction**: Rebuild Huffman tree from compressed file metadata[1]
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory usage during processing[5]
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and validation[6]

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Data Structures Used

| Structure | Purpose | Usage |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)** | Tree construction | Store nodes by frequency for optimal selection[1] |
| **Binary Tree** | Huffman tree representation | Store character codes and frequencies |
| **Unordered Maps** | Character mapping | Store character-to-code and character-to-frequency pairs[2] |
| **Bit Streams** | File I/O | Efficient handling of variable-length codes[5] |

### Algorithm Steps

#### Compression Process
1. **createMinHeap()**: Read input file and build frequency table[1]
2. **createTree()**: Construct Huffman tree using greedy algorithm[1]
3. **createCodes()**: Generate binary codes for each character[1]
4. **saveEncodedFile()**: Write compressed data with file header[1]

#### Decompression Process
1. **getTree()**: Reconstruct Huffman tree from file header[1]
2. **saveDecodedFile()**: Decode binary data back to original characters[1]

### File Format Structure

```
[File Header]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Number of unique characters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Character frequency table
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Huffman tree structure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Compressed Data]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Encoded character sequence
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Padding information
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Operations

#### Compression
```bash
# Compress a file
./file_zipper input.txt compressed.huf

# With custom output name
./file_zipper -o output.huf input.txt
```

#### Decompression
```bash
# Decompress a file
./file_zipper -d compressed.huf output.txt

# With verbose mode
./file_zipper -v -d compressed.huf output.txt
```

### Expected Performance

- **Text Files**: Typically achieve ~50% compression ratio[5][4]
- **Small Files**: May have larger size due to header overhead[7]
- **Large Files**: Better compression ratios as file size increases[7]

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Compression Results
- **Average Compression**: 50% size reduction for text files[5]
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling regardless of file size[5]
- **Processing Speed**: Optimized for both compression and decompression

### Comparison with Other Methods
| Method | Compression Ratio | Performance |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Huffman Coding** | ~50% | Good |
| **gZip** | ~36% | Better |
| **bZip** | ~27% | Best |

*Based on representative test with 6.3MB text file*[5]
